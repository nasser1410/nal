        "description": "Friendship is a beautiful concept, but it’s like a white shirt, a speck of dust rids it of the value which had taken both parties so much time to amass. True friendship is a more realistic take, Because true friends stand up for you. If others try to hurt you, they do everything they can to make sure you stay safe. They don't care who is trying to harm you; they will defend you anytime, anywhere. If they can help you, they'll do it without reservation or without expectation of reward. But it’s exactly because of this that conflicts arise - you have to understand these can be resolved.\r\n\r\nBefore Sohrab, you’ve never really made a true friend. Especially with everything that’s happening around you - you feel so lonely, and it hurts me to see that. I’ve been the same before, too. There was a period of time in my life where I’ve never felt so alone, I wanted nothing more than a friend to laugh with, to play with, even just to argue with. It was exactly them that lifted me into his arms and saved me, pulled me away from the endlessly dark pit I’ve been residing in for all too long, just like it was Sohrab who lifted you into his arms amidst your times of solitude.",

Both have an overpowered teacher you have to beat\r\n2. Both have  some sort of classroom \r\n3. Both contain students who are washouts and the \"losers\". \r\n\r\nSince only the first episode is out, I can't tell much about it. But I have the feeling you might enjoy it, if you like any of these aspects. In my case, it really worked out. I like these concepts.\r\nRecommendation goes in both ways, basically.",

Given that this was directed by Hideaki Anno, I suspected Studio Trigger (studio that was formed by former Gainax animators) may have used this 3-minute promo as some sort of inspiration for Kill la Kill.

Ensemble cast of quirky, distinctive kids with a variety of powers centered around the Protagonist.\r\n\r\nProtagonist - Shigeo is different from Shun certainly. Shigeo's OP, Shun isn't really. But this ties in nicely in my head-canon, because Shun from Gatekeepers is voiced by Sakurai Takahiro, who also voices Reigen on Mob. Shun is always overly cocky and extroverted, so in my mind its kind of like a Reigen-centric coming of age prequel xD \r\n(What if Reigen had powers as a kid and lost them, and then lies so much to compensate for this loss later in life? :OO)\r\n\r\nBonus connection - The design of one of the characters on GK, Kageyama Reiji, reminds me strongly of when we first meet Hanazawa Teru in Mob. (Blond, aloof, uses powers to gain popularity and influence within the school, etc)",

Sawako (Kimi ni Todoke) is a pure-hearted, and compassionate girl who desperately wants friends, but is constantly bullied for her being scary-looking. Her self-deprecation and naivety creates misunderstandings that she is unable to resolve easily since she has no social skills. Bocchi (Bocchi the Rock!) is a nervous trainwreck in a perpetual state of despair who desperately wants to change and have friends, but is incapable of approaching someone. Her self-deprecation and anxiety makes her lie to escape any situation and to appear normal. Anyone who related to these characters should consider this recommendation.",

Both main character have white hair and red eyes\r\n2. Both main character started weak and got abnormally powerful\r\n3. Both have these funny harem elements\r\n4. Both have an adventuring touch\r\nand there is even more.\r\n\r\nAlthough I don't like the harem aspect too much, I love the fact of an insanely powerful main cast. All the similarity make it feel familiar even tough they have different concepts. All in all, I just love this kind of plot line.\r\nBased on this, I recommend this. Recommendation goes in both ways, naturally speaking.",

If you watched both of them, you'll see a lot of similarities.\r\n\r\nSuzuko (Fire Tripper) will kind of remind you of Kagome Higurashi (Inuyasha) given that they both are teenage girls from modern time ended up going to feudal-era Japan. \r\n Shukumaru (Fire Tripper) is not a half-demon like Inuyasha, but both of them defend the main female character, there are differences but I won't spoil them.  But when you watch Fire Tripper you'll realize that's where Inuyasha got part of it's DNA from.  If you wanted to know where Inuyasha's inspiration come from, then I would recommend Fire Tripper.\r\n\r\nFire Tripper is basically Inuyasha Zero, Inuyasha: the beginning, Inuyasha: Origin.  Whatever you want to call it, every Inuyasha fans should watch Fire Tripper to know where one-half of Inuyasha's origin came from.",

It's directed by Daisuke Nishio of Dragonball Z fame.\r\n\r\nAlso this is for all the anime fan parent out there with young kid: If you have a daughter/child as young as 7 years old, but you can't show Sailor Moon in it's uncut form because of the dark subject matter later in the later season, just use Precure as a 7-8 year old friendly alternative if you're concerned about showing Sailor Moon's uncut content.  Precure is more child-friendly for below 9 years old girls if you want to improve their reading skill (Precure is subtitled after all, and the uncut version has no objectionable content other then mild language).",

I want to add that Sukehiro Tomita, the creator of Wedding Peach was also one of the writer for the Sailor Moon TV series.  Also Kazuko Tadano served as a character designer for both Sailor Moon & Wedding Peach TV series.  Also, some of the ideas in Wedding Peach may have derived from Sailor Moon too.  So if you want to watch something similar or feels like Sailor Moon, then Wedding Peach will fill in that same excitement.",

Araburu is a bit more lighthearted than Kuzu no Honkai, but both revel in the painful and destructive side of love. They also share the problem of having way lower MAL scores than their quality of writing deserves because they aren't fluffy happy feel good shows. Both shows have a few problematic characters that I can understand why people hate, but I love them all. Specifically, Hanabi and Niina. If you love one, you will probably love the other.",
